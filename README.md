# Background
In this activity, I created a Lex chabot intended to increase the client's portfolio and engage young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I created a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

## Technologies

This program uses Python 3.7.10, Anaconda version 4.10.3, and Visual Studio Code 1.61.0. It also uses AWS Lex and Lambda. It was written on macOS Catalina 10.15.7.

## Usage

To run this, copy lambda_function.py and paste into your Amazon Lambda service. Create a Lex chabot and link the two. To see how this functions, watch [Movie 2 - Lambda and Lex Integration](https://github.com/toniahurst/FinTech_Module_15_Challenge/blob/main/TH_lambda_and_lex.mov). You will be able to view this as a raw file download.
